	// A value you specify that uniquely identifies this request among all your requests. A common way to create a valid idempotency key is to use a Universally unique identifier (UUID).  If you're unsure whether a particular request was successful, you can reattempt it with the same idempotency key without worrying about creating duplicate objects.  See [Idempotency](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/common-api-patterns/idempotency) for more information.
